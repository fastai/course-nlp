By far, the most common problem is having fastai installed for a different environment/different Python installation than the one your Jupyter notebook is using (you can have Python installed in multiple places on your computer and not even realize it!). Or, you might have different versions of fastai installed in your different environments/different Python installations (and the one you are running in Jupyter notebook could be out of date, even if you installed version 1.0 somewhere else). For both of these problems, please [see this entry](https://docs.fast.ai/troubleshoot.html#modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-fastaivision)."
