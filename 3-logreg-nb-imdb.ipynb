      "xxbos xxmaj un - xxunk - believable ! xxmaj meg xxmaj ryan does n't even look her usual xxunk lovable self in this , which normally makes me forgive her shallow xxunk acting xxunk . xxmaj hard to believe she was the producer on this dog . xxmaj plus xxmaj kevin xxmaj kline : what kind of suicide trip has his career been on ? xxmaj xxunk ... xxmaj xxunk ! ! ! xxmaj finally this was directed by the guy who did xxmaj big xxmaj xxunk ? xxmaj must be a replay of xxmaj jonestown - hollywood style . xxmaj xxunk !,xxbos xxmaj this is a extremely well - made film . xxmaj the acting , script and camera - work are all first - rate . xxmaj the music is good , too , though it is mostly early in the film , when things are still relatively xxunk . xxmaj there are no really xxunk in the cast , though several faces will be familiar . xxmaj the entire cast does an excellent job with the script . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj but it is hard to watch , because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented . xxmaj it is now xxunk to blame the xxmaj british for setting xxmaj hindus and xxmaj muslims against each other , and then xxunk xxunk them into two countries . xxmaj there is some merit in this view , but it 's also true that no one forced xxmaj hindus and xxmaj muslims in the region to xxunk each other as they did around the time of partition . xxmaj it seems more likely that the xxmaj british simply saw the xxunk between the xxunk and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj the result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen . xxmaj but it is never painted as a black - and - white case . xxmaj there is xxunk and xxunk on both sides , and also the hope for change in the younger generation . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj there is redemption of a sort , in the end , when xxmaj xxunk has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life , but also truly loved her , and her family which has xxunk her , then later come looking for her . xxmaj but by that point , she has no xxunk that is without great pain for her . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj this film carries the message that both xxmaj muslims and xxmaj hindus have their grave xxunk , and also that both can be xxunk and caring people . xxmaj the reality of partition makes that xxunk all the more wrenching , since there can never be real xxunk across the xxmaj india / xxmaj pakistan border . xxmaj in that sense , it is similar to \" xxmaj mr & xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk \" . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj in the end , we were glad to have seen the film , even though the resolution was xxunk . xxmaj if the xxup uk and xxup us could deal with their own xxunk of racism with this kind of xxunk , they would certainly be better off .,xxbos xxmaj every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people . xxmaj if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie , how great will be my joy . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj where to begin my discussion of pain . xxmaj for xxunk , there was a musical xxunk every five minutes . xxmaj there was no character development . xxmaj every character was a stereotype . xxmaj we had xxunk guy , fat guy who eats donuts , goofy foreign guy , etc . xxmaj the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot . xxmaj the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation . xxmaj have the directors , producers , etc . ever even seen a movie before ? xxmaj xxunk is getting worse and worse with every new entry . xxmaj the concept for this movie sounded so funny . xxmaj how could you go wrong with xxmaj gary xxmaj coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors . xxmaj but trust me when i say this , things went wrong , xxup very xxup wrong .,xxbos xxmaj name just says it all . i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in xxmaj xxunk he had great admiration for the man . xxmaj the disappointing thing about this film is that it only xxunk on a short period of the man 's life - interestingly enough the man 's entire life would have made such an epic bio - xxunk that it is staggering to imagine the cost for production . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj some posters xxunk to the flawed xxunk about the man , which are cheap shots . xxmaj the theme of the movie \" xxmaj duty , xxmaj honor , xxmaj country \" are not just mere words xxunk from the lips of a high - xxunk officer - it is the deep xxunk of one man 's total devotion to his country . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj ironically xxmaj xxunk being the liberal that he was xxunk a better understanding of the man . xxmaj he does a great job showing the xxunk general xxunk with the xxunk side of the man .,xxbos xxmaj this movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you 've seen . xxmaj however this comes from the fact that you ca n't make heads or xxunk of this mess . xxmaj it almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid . xxmaj if you do n't want to feel xxunk you 'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved , they 've all seen better days , but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you 'll lose pity for them just like you 've already done for the film . i ca n't go on enough about this horrible movie , its almost something that xxmaj ed xxmaj wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj to start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you 've never seen / heard , this thing has got to be five minutes long . xxmaj on top of that it is narrated , as to suggest that you the viewer can not read . xxmaj then we meet xxmaj mr. xxmaj xxunk and the xxunk of terrible lines gets xxunk , it is as if he is xxunk solely to get lines on to the movie poster xxunk line . xxmaj soon we meet xxmaj stephen xxmaj xxunk , who i typically enjoy ) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does . xxmaj then comes the ultimate insult , xxmaj tara xxmaj xxunk playing an intelligent role , oh help us ! xxmaj tara xxmaj xxunk is not a very talented actress and somehow she xxunk gets roles in movies , in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the xxmaj american pie type . \n",
      " \n",
      "  xxmaj all in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video , i know that i got a kick out of it , i mean lets all be honest here , sometimes its comforting to xxunk in the shortcomings of others .\n",

       "xxbos xxmaj once again xxmaj mr. xxmaj costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary . xxmaj aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences , of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters . xxmaj most of us have ghosts in the closet , and xxmaj costner 's character are realized early on , and then forgotten until much later , by which time i did not care . xxmaj the character we should really care about is a very cocky , overconfident xxmaj ashton xxmaj kutcher . xxmaj the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he 's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet . xxmaj his only obstacle appears to be winning over xxmaj costner . xxmaj finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker , xxmaj costner tells us all about xxmaj kutcher 's ghosts . xxmaj we are told why xxmaj kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing . xxmaj no magic here , it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in .,xxbos xxmaj this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . xxmaj generic and boring , there 's really nothing worth watching here . a complete waste of the then barely - tapped talents of xxmaj ice - t and xxmaj ice xxmaj cube , who 've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting , and acting well . xxmaj do n't bother with this one , go see xxmaj new xxmaj jack xxmaj city , xxmaj ricochet or watch xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj undercover for xxmaj ice - t , or xxmaj boyz n the xxmaj hood , xxmaj higher xxmaj learning or xxmaj friday for xxmaj ice xxmaj cube and see the real deal . xxmaj ice - t 's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth , and i 'm still wondering what the heck xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton was doing in this film ? xxmaj and why the heck does he always play the exact same character ? xxmaj from xxmaj aliens onward , every film i 've seen with xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character , and at least in xxmaj aliens his character died , which made it somewhat gratifying ... \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj overall , this is second - rate action trash . xxmaj there are countless better films to see , and if you really want to see this one , watch xxmaj judgement xxmaj night , which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script . xxmaj the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing , which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite . 4 / 10 .,xxbos xxmaj first of all i hate those moronic rappers , who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads . xxmaj all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like xxunk version of gangsters . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the movie does n't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we 're already at the warehouse xxmaj there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie , except for the homeless guy , who is also the only one with half a brain . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton and xxmaj william xxmaj sadler are both hill xxunk and xxmaj xxunk character is just as much a villain as the gangsters . i did'nt like him right from the start . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the movie is filled with pointless violence and xxmaj walter xxmaj hills specialty : people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere . xxmaj there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no - one . xxmaj everybody dies , except from xxmaj paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they 're actors by profession , not annoying ugly brain dead rappers . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead . xxmaj at lest they have characters you care about , a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast .,xxbos xxmaj not even the xxmaj beatles could write songs everyone liked , and although xxmaj walter xxmaj hill is no mop - top he 's second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies . xxmaj the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film , the emergence of the xxmaj rapper turned movie star was in full swing , the acting took a back seat to each man 's overpowering regional accent and transparent acting . xxmaj this was one of the many ice - t movies i saw as a kid and loved , only to watch them later and cringe . xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton and xxmaj william xxmaj sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications . i hand it to xxmaj walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location . xxmaj but i fault everyone involved for turning out xxmaj lame - o performances . xxmaj ice - t and cube must have been red hot at this time , and while i 've enjoyed both their careers as rappers , in my opinion they fell flat in this movie . xxmaj it 's about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief . xxmaj now this is a movie , its not a documentary so i wo nt waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie , but there were many , and they led nowhere . i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was xxunk of confused and just playing things off the cuff . xxmaj there are two things i still enjoy about it , one involves a scene with a needle and the other is xxmaj sadler 's huge 45 pistol . xxmaj bottom line this movie is like domino 's pizza . xxmaj yeah ill eat it if i 'm hungry and i do n't feel like cooking , xxmaj but i 'm well aware it tastes like crap . 3 stars , meh .,xxbos xxmaj brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . xxmaj their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class xxup tv commercials . xxmaj but unfortunately xxmaj brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours ! xxmaj in this they fail miserably , their undeniable , but rather soft and flabby than steamy , erotic qualities non withstanding . \n",

       "  xxmaj xxunk ' 45 is a remake of a film by xxmaj luchino xxmaj visconti with the same title and xxmaj alida xxmaj valli and xxmaj farley xxmaj granger in the lead . xxmaj the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around xxmaj venice during the xxmaj italian wars of independence . xxmaj brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century , 1945 to be exact , so there are xxmaj mussolini xxunk , men in black shirts , xxmaj german uniforms or the tattered garb of the xxunk . xxmaj but it is just window dressing , the historic context is completely negligible . \n",

       "  xxmaj anna xxmaj xxunk plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral xxup ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick . xxmaj she is an attractive , versatile , well trained xxmaj italian actress and clearly above the material . xxmaj her wide range of facial expressions ( xxunk boredom , loathing , delight , fear , hate ... and ecstasy ) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars . xxmaj she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity . i wish some really good parts come along for her . xxmaj she really deserves it .\n",
