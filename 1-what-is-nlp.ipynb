    "I'll be using a *top-down* teaching method, which is different from how most CS/math courses operate.  Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n",

In the 1990s, there was a change towards using statistical & machine learning approaches, but the complexity of natural language meant that simple statistical approaches were often not state-of-the-art. We are now currently in the midst of a major change in the move towards neural networks.  Because deep learning allows for much greater complexity, it is now achieving state-of-the-art for many things.\n",
