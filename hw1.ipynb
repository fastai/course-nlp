There is a notion of success ... which I think is novel in the history of science. It interprets success as approximating unanalyzed data.\"\n",

Certainly a human can't understand such a model by inspecting the values of each parameter individually. But one can gain insight by examing the properties of the model—where it succeeds and fails, how well it learns as a function of data, etc.\"\n",
